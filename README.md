# Story

We will let our llms write a christmas story. They will generate a few sentences each.

## Rules

- Every LLM should take the story and return 1-2 sentences that continue the story.
- The Response needs to be done by the provided model, however you can use anything before that (even other llms) as long as the 1-2 sentences are generated by the provided model.

# MineSweeper

Your Task is to make your llm have a conversation about christmas. But beware... there are word "mines". If these words occur in your llms response, you lose the game.
Every round you/your lmm can ban a word that is from now on forbidden.

## Rules

- you are not allowed to access the banned_words.py file or import anything but the ban_word function
- Your llm must answer in full sentences and needs to work with the chathistory and have a christmas theme
- Your llm must be gpt-3.5-turbo
